# Small Office Infrastructure Lab
A fully virtualized small-office IT environment designed to simulate real-world infrastructure used in SMEs. This project showcases networking, system administration, security hardening, monitoring, and documentation skills relevant to IT Infrastructure, NOC, and SysAdmin roles.

## 📌 Project Summary

This lab simulates a 20-user company with multiple departments, a segmented network, centralized identity management, secure file sharing, monitoring, and logging. Everything is built using open-source and enterprise tools:

- pfSense for firewalling and VLAN segmentation
- Windows Server 2022 for Active Directory, DNS, DHCP, and GPO
- Windows Server 2022 for file services
- Ubuntu Server for Linux workloads
- Zabbix for monitoring
- Graylog/Wazuh for centralized logging

This mirrors how a real small-to-medium company operates.


## 📡 Network Architecture

The network is segmented into multiple VLANs following least-privilege principles:

| VLAN | Name        | Subnet         | Purpose                              |
|------|-------------|----------------|--------------------------------------|
| 10   | Server      | 10.10.10.0/24  | Domain controller, file server, etc. |
| 20   | Management  | 10.10.20.0/24  | Admin and server management          |
| 30   | Staff       | 10.10.30.0/24  | General employee devices             |
| 40   | Finance     | 10.10.40.0/24  | Restricted finance users             |
| 50   | Guest       | 10.10.50.0/24  | Internet-only guest network          |

A full network diagram is included in the `diagrams/` folder.

## 🧪 Skills Demonstrated

This lab highlights practical skills useful for infra and sysadmin roles:

- VLAN and subnet design
- Identity-based access control
- Windows and Linux server administration
- Group Policy management
- File sharing permissions (NTFS and Linux)
- Firewall rules and segmentation
- Monitoring and alerting
- Log centralization
- Backup strategy design
- Infrastructure documentation
- Troubleshooting and hardening


## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this lab is to demonstrate real-world IT infrastructure skills that employers look for in junior SysAdmin, Infrastructure, and NOC positions.


## 🚀 Future Enhancements
